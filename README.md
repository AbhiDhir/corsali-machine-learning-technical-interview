# Corsali Machine Learning Technical Interview

This is our project-based technical interview for machine learning engineers. It gives us a chance to see your abilities and how you approach problems. It is designed to give you creative freedom as you develop a solution, and consists of a model implementation quesion as well as non-coding questions below. Please complete both secionts 

## Coding questions
Please answer t

## Non-coding questions
Please answer the non-coding questions below by editing this readme

1. You are given a dataset of 1500 company descriptions and must classify them into 6 categories. You train a logistic regression, but it only has 60% accuracy. Your task is to identify which types of data are underrepresented in the dataset in order to prioritize

2. You are choosing the best way to represent a text company description as an input to a model. Describe the trade offs between bag-of-words, word embeddings, and any other representation you may choose. 

_Type your answer to question 2 here_

3. You decide to use a recurrent neural network for the text classification task instead. You implement the model in PyTorch and find that it's very accuracte, but that the model evaluation is too slow. How would you accelerate the model prediction time?
